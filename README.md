Big Data Architecture Project
ATLS 5214

Project Objective: Create a heat map of the United States that will indicate the level of hate/racisim/bullying/threats from Twitter tweets, organized per state. 

Our project analyzes the percentage of these tweets relative to the total number of tweets per state. Given the recent political sentiments, societal changes, and prevalence of technology, we wanted to see what feelings might be reflected on social media. We believe that Twitter allows people to easily express opinions publicly, and as such there would be a large amount of data to analyze. Ultimately, our goal was to create a full-stack of streaming data from Twitter’s API to process the tweets and store them into a database. We score the tweets based on a sentiment analysis, and reflect these scores on our visualization home page.
